# MachineFailureReasonsClassification-PowerBI-Python

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Project Name:** RPA Logs Report
**Tool Used:** Power BI
**Domain:** Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Analytics
**Objective:** To monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of automated bots by visualizing their operational logs and identifying failure patterns, utilization, and SLA compliance.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Before this project, the RPA operations team lacked a centralized way to track and analyze how well their bots were performing.
They had raw log files — containing details like when bots started, ended, failed, or retried — but:

* There was no consolidated dashboard.
* Failures were hard to diagnose.
* Performance trends were invisible.
* Management couldn’t easily assess ROI or efficiency.

So, I developed a **Power BI dashboard** to convert raw RPA logs into **actionable insights** for operations, developers, and management.

## 🧩 Project Goals

1. Track **bot performance** in real time (success vs failure rates).
2. Measure **SLA compliance** for each automated process.
3. Identify **root causes of bot failures**.
4. Understand **robot utilization** — how much each bot is used vs idle.
5. Provide a **drill-down view** to analyze specific run details.

## 🔄 Data Sources and Preparation

The data was collected from **RPA logs** generated by the automation orchestrator (e.g., UiPath or Automation Anywhere).
These logs were exported as Excel/CSV files or pulled from a database.

**Main datasets included:**

* **Run Logs:** Each bot run’s start time, end time, duration, and status (Success, Failed, Terminated).
* **Exception Logs:** Error messages and failure causes.
* **Robot Master Table:** Robot names, environment, and departments.
* **Process Metadata:** SLA targets and process owners.
* **Calendar Table:** Date, month, weekday, business day flag.

**Data Cleaning & Transformation (in Power Query):**

* Removed duplicates and nulls.
* Converted timestamps to datetime format and extracted date/hour.
* Standardized status names (“Successful”, “Finished”, etc. → “Success”).
* Calculated new columns like:

  * Run Duration (End Time – Start Time)
  * SLA Breach Flag (if duration > SLA target)
  * Week, Month, and Quarter fields.

## 🧱 Data Model Design

I built a **star schema** model for optimized analysis and performance.

* **Fact Table:** `Fact_Runs` – contains each bot run record.
* **Dimension Tables:**

  * `Dim_Process` – process details and SLA time.
  * `Dim_Robot` – robot metadata.
  * `Dim_Date` – date hierarchy (day, week, month).
  * `Dim_Exception` – error types.

Relationships were created (1-to-many) between dimensions and the fact table, enabling flexible filtering and time-series analysis.

## 📊 Key Metrics & KPIs

The report included several calculated measures built in **DAX**:

| Metric                      | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Total Runs**              | Total number of bot executions.           |
| **Successful Runs**         | Count of runs with “Success” status.      |
| **Failed Runs**             | Count of runs with “Failed” status.       |
| **Success Rate (%)**        | Successful runs ÷ total runs.             |
| **Average Run Duration**    | Average processing time of all runs.      |
| **SLA Compliance (%)**      | Percentage of runs completed within SLA.  |
| **Top 5 Failing Processes** | Highest failure counts or rates.          |
| **Robot Utilization (%)**   | Total bot runtime ÷ total available time. |

These metrics helped both developers and managers monitor daily operations and long-term efficiency.

## 📈 Dashboard & Visuals

The Power BI report was divided into **three main pages**:

### 1. **Executive Overview**

* KPI cards showing:

  * Total Runs
  * Success Rate
  * SLA Compliance
  * Average Duration
* Trend line: daily runs with success/failure breakdown.
* Donut chart: Failure reasons (system error, data issue, etc.).
* Bar chart: Top 10 processes by total runs.

### 2. **Operational Analysis**

* Heatmap showing runs by hour and weekday (to find peak load times).
* Table of all runs with conditional formatting (red for failures).
* Filters for date, robot, process, and environment.
* Drillthrough feature to view detailed logs of a selected run.

### 3. **Exception Insights**

* Clustered bar chart for top exception types.
* Table showing error messages and affected processes.
* Trend showing failure frequency over time.
